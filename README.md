# Learning Physics With Functional Programming
This repo contains my solutions to the exercise questions from "Learn Physics with Functional Programming" by Scott W. Walker. I am working through this textbook for educational purposes and have only included the exercise questions, my written work and my rationale as solutions to the questions. Because this book does not contain an answers section, these problems were solved by me and may not be reliable.
