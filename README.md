# Learning Physics With Functional Programming
This repo contains my solutions to the exercise questions from "Learn Physics with Functional Programming" by Scott W. Walker. I am working through this textbook for educational purposes and have only included the exercise questions, my written work and rationale for my solutions to the questions. The book does not contain an answers section.
